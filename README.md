# Birdbot

The purpose of this bot is to identify and classify the species of some of the common birds throughout the world. This bot will spot a bird using a camera and then print out the results of the classification so the user can see what species of bird it sees.

## The Algorithm

The algorithm for this bot works by running the camera connected to it and streaming live. When it sees a bird, it will guess what species of bird it is. The bot has been trained through a large dataset so it should be able to correctly identify the species. It will then display what species it thinks the bird is.

## Running this project

To run this project the user must start the webcam first. They must next make sure that their Jetson Nano is connected to a computer or laptop that it will display information on.
No libraries are needed for this project besides Resnet-18. The user can change what types of birds the bot will recognize by running different datasets that can be found online.
